    <h1>The nanocar project user study</h1>
    <p>This is the webpage for the nano car user study. Here you will find a set of instructions to guid you through the user study and links to each component. It's important that you go through this page from top to bottom and don't use any other means to find the answers.
        Please use a device with a large screen if possible.
    </p>
    <h2>User study</h2>
    <p>Start by opening the Google Form (link is at the bottom of this paragraph). In the first section of the user study is a test on your current knowledge. At this point it does not matter what you know about the nanocar just guess if you don't know the answer. Important here is that you only fill in the first section!</p>

    <h2>Presentation</h2>
    <p>In this section you can take a look at the presentation. When you click on the link a new tab is opened showing the presentation. One can navigate through the presentation only with a curser or touch. By clicking on the slider on the left one can navigate to the different scales. By clicking on the objects on the screen a popup will explain what you see. Note that some object are small and thus hard to click on. in some scenes you will see orbs and bonds click on the orbs.</p>
    <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://molecular-car-project.github.io/WebBuild/Presentation"><button type="button">Click here to open the presentation.</button></a>
    <h2>Game</h2>
    <p>Up next is the game. Click the link and the game will show up in another tab. Click play. You can drive the car by clicking on it. If you click on the wheels (red) the 2 wheels on that side will spin, if you click on the body (white) all 4 wheels will spin. The wheels make one full rotation per click. The goal is to reach the finish in the shortest time. To reach the finish drive towards the top of your screen. The finish is recognizable as a transparent orange orb. Note keep an eye on the bar on the left. When it reaches the top the game resets (the car explodes). </p>

    <h2>User study continuation</h2>
